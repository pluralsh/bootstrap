# Bootstrapping from an Empty Existing Cluster

This will guide teams new to kubernetes how to setup a fresh cluster with what's needed to install your instance of the Plural console. There are three main things we're going to try to get into this cluster:

* cert-manager - this is used to issue certificates with the ACME protocol
* external-dns - this is used to wire DNS records against common cloud DNS providers to k8s load balancer resources
* ingress-nginx - a well-supported ingress controller to handle complex load balancing and routing setups

## General Flow

You'll need to do a few things to get set up:

* Install cloud prereqs via terraform
* install cert-manager and our runtime chart via helm
* install Plural Console via helm
* set up a bootstrapping Plural service to subscribe to future updates

To do all this, you'll want to create your own git repo to copy code into and keep a record of what's been done.  None of the code will require committing any secrets.

To setup your repo you'll want to copy the following folders in your fresh git repo:

* terraform/clouds/{cloud} -> terraform/mgmt
* existing/terraform/{cloud} -> terraform/externaldns
* exsting/test/{cloud}/*.tf -> terraform/*.tf (you'll need to rewire the `source` fields for the modules and make variable name changes)
* existing/setup -> setup
* helm -> helm-values

## Installing Cloud Prereqs

Within the `terraform/{cloud}` folders here, there are simple terraform stacks to set up the needed cloud resources.  These are usually IAM bindings.  You can reference `test/{cloud}` to see how they're used, and if you want you can use our terraform to set up our cluster as well.  You'll want to first copy the relevant terraform code into a working folder in your git repo, we'd recommend just naming it `/terraform`, then run:

```sh
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform output -json
```

The outputs will be needed later

## Install Helm Charts

Next you'll want to copy our helm values files `helm/certmanager.yaml` and `helm/runtime.yaml` to a folder in your git repo, in our setup the folder will be `/helm-values`, and make the minor modifications the comments specify w/ the outputs from terraform.  For instance, on Azure, it'll want you to set workload identity annotations like:

```yaml
external-dns:
  serviceAccount:
    annotations:
      azure.workload.identity/client-id: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
```

Before running any helm commands, you'll need to be able to kubectl on your cluster.  For azure, this would be running the command:

```sh
az aks get-credentials -n {cluster-name} -g {resource-group}
kubectl get pods -A # to confirm
```

(AWS, GCP, etc have their own kubectl commands to navigate).

The helm commands to run once those files have been copied and modified and you have kubectl to your cluster are:

```sh
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io || helm repo update
helm repo add plrl-bootstrap https://pluralsh.github.io/bootstrap || helm repo update
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager -f helm-values/certmanager.yaml -n cert-manager
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace plrl-runtime plrl-bootstrap/runtime -f helm-values/runtime.yaml -n plrl-runtime
```

## Install the Plural Console

From here you can use the BYOK install process described at https://docs.plural.sh/deployments/existing-cluster.  As a tldr, you'll run the following commands:

```sh
plural login
plural cd control-plane
```

You might need to install the plural cli, which is available on homebrew via: `brew install pluralsh/plural/plural`

The `plural cd control-plane` command generates the helm values you need to install the plural console to a file `values.secret.yaml`, which will then be applied with:

```sh
helm repo add plrl-console https://pluralsh.github.io/console
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace -f values.secret.yaml console plrl-console/console -n plrl-console
```

Note the secret in that filename is not incidental, you will definitely want to avoid committing that file, and the subsequent steps will detail how to securely manage it.

To track rollout status, you can run `kubectl get pods -n plrl-console`. It might take a bit of time for the initial db migrations to complete, so you'll see some things error until that happens.  You can also run `kubectl get certificate -n plrl-console` to verify that all certs were issued before finally visiting the url of your console.

## Setup Continuous Updates

From there, you'll want to copy the `existing/setup` folder to your working git repository, add that git repository to the plural console by navigating to the ui at `https://{your-console-url}/cd/repos`.  NOTE: you'll want to update the url of `existing/setup/gitrepository.yaml`.

From there, you'll want to first save your values file as a k8s secret:

```sh
kubectl create ns infra
kubectl create secret generic console-values --from-file=values.yaml=values.secret.yaml -n infra
```

Then you should be able to create the initial bootstrapping service by creating a Plural service at `https://{your-console-url}/cd/services` with the attributes:

```
Namespace:  infra
Name:       setup
Cluster:    <management-cluster>
Repository: <your-repository-url>
Branch:     main
Folder:     setup
```

These can all be entered in our UI for simplicity, and from there, you can use your git repository to GitOps freely.

Once this is complete, we strongly recommend you keep the `values.secret.yaml` file somewhere safe in case you need it in the future, although it'll also be stored securely in the k8s secret we just created as well. *Do not commit it to the repo.*
